# Generic Object - Python

Sometimes I wish I didn't have to keep using all sorts of dictionary indexes into JSON objects.....

This sometime, I decided I wanted to see what it would take to turn a JSON object into a class structure that I could use dot notation on the object to access the underlying property values. 

That's all this is....a way to transform a JSON object, dict or list into a class that you can use dot notation on. 

See run.py to figure out how to use it, if you have any interest at all.
